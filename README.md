# Fraud Detection
This project is about building a fraud detection tool from creditcard transactions, using around 30 parameters from customers. 
Different over/under sampling techniques were utilized to prepare the imbalanced data, while the model performance was evaluated using ROC & Precision-Recall curves.
The model was finally containerized with Docker and deployed as REST API on cloud (AWS) using Python, Flask and Amazon EC2.
